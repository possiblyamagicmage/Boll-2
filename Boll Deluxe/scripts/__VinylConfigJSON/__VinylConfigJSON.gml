/// defined in this script by passing it into VinylSetupImportJSON(). You can configure the
/// entirety of your game audio from this one script in most cases.
/// 
/// If VINYL_LIVE_EDIT is set to <true> then editing this JSON file will quickly be reflected in
/// audio currently playing in your game. The live update feature does have limitations, however.
/// This feature is only available when running on Windows, Mac, or Linux. Furthermore, the GML
/// parser used to power live updating is very simple. You should treat the JSON written in this

    Here are some examples of different resources you can create using JSON. This is not an
    exhaustive list; please see "Vinyl JSON Format" for more information.
    
    
    
    // -- Simple sound gain adjustment
    //    All sounds can have their gain adjusted using the following JSON syntax.
    {
        sound: sndJump,
        gain: 0.9,
    },
    
    
    
    // -- Sound randomization
    //    The "shuffle" pattern can be used to choose a random sound to play. Vinyl will try to
    //    ensure that one sound is not repeatedly played.
    {
        shuffle: "coin",
        sound: [sndCoin1, sndCoin2, sndCoin3, sndCoin4, sndCoin5],
    },
    
    
    
    // -- Pitch variance
    //    Shuffle patterns can also be used to randomize pitch for a sound. If you specify a two-
    //    element array then Vinyl will randomize the pitch between those two values. You can also
    //    apply pitch randomization to sound randomization too.
    {
        shuffle: "jump variance",
        sound: sndJump,
        pitch: [1, 1.1],
    },
    
    
    
    // -- Head-Loop-Tail
    //    This kind of pattern will play the "head" sound, then loop the "loop" sound, and then
    //    will play the "tail" sound after that. You should use VinylSetLoop() to control when to
    //    move from the "loop" sound to the "tail" sound.

    },
    
    
    
    // -- Blend
    //    The final type of pattern will mix together multiple sounds using the "blend factor" set
    //    by VinylSetBlendFactor(). The default behaviour is to sweep between different sounds but
    //    you can also use an animation curve to control gains.

    //    Mixes allow you to do this. Any sound or pattern that is defined as a "member" of a mix
    //    will automatically have its gain adjusted when you adjust the gain for the mix as a
    //    whole. Please note that mixes cannot be defined inside other mixes i.e. there's no
    //    hierarchical mix behaviour.
